# Use: Add systems to this file for use with the gluster_install.yml and
# gluster_client.yml playbooks. Note that all these systems need to have forward
# AND reverse DNS working correctly and static hostname set. Delete or comment
# out any unused nodes or nodes to exclude from a particular run. Add nodes or
# clients as desired.
